Train Schedule

Technologies used: jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Moment.js.

The user inputs a train name, destination, time of first departure, and frequency of arrivals. The input is dynamically added to the database and displayed instantly through a Firebase API. Using Moment.js, the time from the initial departure time and the present time are compared, and the time of the next arrival is calculated. The user can also see how many minutes away the next train is.
